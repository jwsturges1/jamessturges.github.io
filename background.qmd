### Scientific Background

<img src="family.jpg" width="300" height="200" style="float:right; margin-left: 20px;"/> I grew up in northern Virginia, just outside the D.C. area and and developed a passion for the outdoors early. I have to credit my parents for generating a deep respect for the environment and instilling a sense of global community in me from the start. My dad is an avid hunter, and years in the woods with him laid the foundation for interests in resource management and conservation. My mom is an avid traveler and she taught me that the world is only as small as you make it. With their support I moved 3000 miles away to begin my scientific journey at the University of Southern California and it was probably one of the best decisions of my life.

My thesis research quantified the amount of nitrogen and phosphorus delivered by sucker fish via excretion, eggs, and carcasses during their annual spawning migrations. My time at TTU was extremely rewarding. My advisor was hugely supportive and fostered an environment in which I was able to pursue my own research questions related to my thesis. I also discovered my love for teaching, as I taught biology and ecology courses for five semesters. Conveying my passion for science to excited students was very fulfilling and solidified my desire to pursue a career in academia with research and teaching duties.

Across the last few years, I have spent the majority of my time working in Everglades National Park (ENP). I am currently leading two projects related to my dissertation research: (I) The South Florida Coastal Everglades Array (SRFCEA), which has been monitoring the movements of several ecologically and economically important fishes (i.e., Common Snook, Largemouth Bass, Bull Shark) using passive acoustic telemetry in the Shark River, ENP since 2011 and (II) the United States Army Corp of Engineer RECOVER Monitoring and Assessment Program (USACE RECOVER-MAP) which has been monitoring fish community composition at the marsh-mangrove interface in the Shark River, ENP since 2004. These projects, plus our food web monitoring program (2019-present) that I work closely with, are associated with the Florida Coastal Everglades Long-Term Research (FCE-LTER) program.

My dissertation research uses stable isotope biogeochemistry to

aspects of each of these projects to investigate the drivers of consumer-mediated nutrient dynamics (CND) across scales of ecological organization (individual-, population-, and community-) in the Shark River, ENP. focused I am fortunate to be the principal investigator of a synthesis working group funded by the US-LTER which aims to characterize spatiotemporal patterns in CND under the wake of global change across long-term research programs globally. Our working group is 20 members strong with representation across career stages and ecosystems (pelagic zooplankton communities in the Gulf of Alaska to coral reef fish communities in French Polynesia).
