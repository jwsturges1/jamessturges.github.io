My research experience spans multiple ecosystems including kelp forests, mangroves rivers, and marine seagrass meadows.{{< fa ship >}}. I have brief experience with population and circadian genetics. One of my favorite places is Santa Catalina Island, where I spent a summer as an REU {{< fa tree >}}. My work centers upon energy flow across trophic pathways, niche dynamics, community trajectories, and restoration ecology. Several

# Patterns in basal resource use and energy flow

#### **The quantity, quality, and origin of basal resources entering food webs can have strong effects on the function and structure of systems with implications for stability within and across ecosystems**
