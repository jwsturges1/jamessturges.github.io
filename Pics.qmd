# Photo Gallery

This is a collection of some of my favorite photos. Click on any image to view it in full size.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
library(htmltools)

# List of image files (replace with your actual file names)
image_files <- c("pic1.jpg", "pic2.jpg", "pic3.jpg", "pic4.jpg")

# Function to create an image card
create_image_card <- function(img_file) {
  tags$div(
    class = "image-card",
    tags$a(
      href = img_file, 
      tags$img(src = img_file, class = "img-thumbnail", style = "width:100%")
    )
  )
}

# Generate the gallery
gallery <- lapply(image_files, create_image_card)

# Display the gallery in a grid
tags$div(class = "gallery-grid", gallery)
